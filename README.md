# anki-chinese-hanzi-to-heisig

Anki plugin translating chinese hanzi to English after Heizig's Remembering Simplified Hanzi

When editing (new or existing) cards with a field called `Hanzi` a translation is automatically written into the `Heisig English Keywords` field. This triggers, when the `Hanzi` field loses focus, i.e. when your cursor leaves the field.

## Installation

copy the `heisiginfo` folder into your anki plugin folder. E.g.

```
...\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\addons21\heisiginfo
```
